- **Features**:
  - Order creation with ticket reservation
  - Order cancellation with ticket release
  - Lock-based order creation for real-time concurrency
  - Integration with events-service for ticket validation
  - Integration with realtime-service for lock confirmation
  - Comprehensive logging and error handling

### 6. ✨ Realtime Service (Port: 8880)
- **Purpose**: Real-time ticket locking and live updates
- **Features**:
  - WebSocket-based real-time communication
  - Ticket locking system with 5-minute expiration
  - Real-time availability updates
  - Order completion/cancellation notifications
  - Integration with events-service for accurate availability
  - RabbitMQ integration for service communication
  - Concurrency control and lock management

## 🔄 Complete Integration Flow

### Standard Order Flow
```
User → API Gateway → Orders Service → Events Service → Database
```

### Enhanced Real-time Flow
```
User → Frontend (WebSocket) → Realtime Service (Lock Tickets)
      ↓
User → API Gateway → Orders Service → Confirm Lock → Database
                                   ↓
                        Realtime Service → All Connected Users (Updates)
```

## 🔐 Security Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Role-based Access Control**: Customer and organizer roles
- **Ownership Validation**: Users can only modify their own resources
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive data validation
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses

## 📡 Real-time Features

### WebSocket Events
- **Client → Server**:
  - `join-event-room`: Join event for updates
  - `lock-tickets`: Lock tickets for purchase
  - `unlock-tickets`: Release locked tickets
  - `heartbeat`: Keep connection alive

- **Server → Client**:
  - `availability-update`: Real-time ticket availability
  - `order-completed`: Order success notification
  - `order-cancelled`: Order cancellation notification
  - `lock-tickets-response`: Lock operation result

### Lock Management
- **5-minute expiration**: Automatic cleanup of expired locks
- **Concurrency control**: Prevent overselling
- **Real-time updates**: Instant availability changes
- **User session tracking**: Per-user lock management

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. PostgreSQL running with databases: `events_db`, `orders_db`, `user_db`
2. RabbitMQ running (default: admin:admin)
3. Node.js and npm installed

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
